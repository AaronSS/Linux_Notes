# ArchLinux Package Management


* Package Management
** Build and install from source
#+begin_src text
   ./configure
   make
   as-root make install
#+end_src
** How to manage packages
*** All in My Hand
*** Install in separate Directories
*** Symlink Style
#+begin_src text
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    make DESTDIR=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1 install
#+end_src
*** Timestamp Based
*** Tracing installation script
*** Package archives
+ RPM, apt, Portage
+ tar based system
*** User based

* PKGBUILD, makepkg
** PKGBUILD
   A bash script that describes the package information
and the way to build it.
*** variables
    pkgname, pkgver, depends, provides, conflicts
*** functions
    pkgver(), prepare(), build(), package()
*** installation script
** makepkg
   Make an Arch package.
** mkaurball
+ From community/pkgbuild-introspection
+ Make AUR tarball

* pacman
** File system based package management
*** =/var/lib/pacman/sync/=
    repository files, all tarballs
*** =/var/lib/pacman/local/=
+ packages installed
+ All info in =/var/lib/pacman/local/$pkgname-$pkgver/=
**** desc
     Package description
**** files
     Files belong to the packages
**** mtree
+ Begin in pacman-4.1.1
+ A feature from libarchive
+ help to check the integrity of a package
+ Generate mtree: =bsdtar -cf MTREE --format=mtree --options=all *=
** Install and update packages: =pacman -S=
   Issue =pacman -S <pkg>/<group>= to install a package,
or a group of packages.
*** Sync repositories: =pacman -Sy=
    Use =pacman -Syy= for force sync repositories.
*** Update all packages: =pacman -Su=
+ The most notable command: =pacman -Syu=
+ -uu option to force sync a package (to an old one)
*** Search: =pacman -Ss=
*** Detailed information: =pacman -Si=
** Install a local package: =pacman -U=
   Note that pacman has a cache directory =/var/cache/pacman/pkg/=
** Query packages installed: =pacman -Q=
+ Detailed information: =pacman -Qi=
+ Only show package name (ignore version): =pacman -Qq=
*** Search packages installed: =pacman -Qs=
*** List files owned by a package: =pacman -Ql=
*** Check integrity: =pacman -Qk=
+ And =pacman -Qkk= for a deep check
** Remove packages: =pacman -R=
+ =pacman -Rc <pkgs>=: remove <pkgs> and packages depend on them
+ =pacman -Rs <pkgs>=: remove <pkgs> and packages they depend on
+ often use =pacman -Rcs <pkgs>=
** Packages not from repositories: =pacman -Qm=
* pacman utilities
  Useful tools about Arch packages, some merged from pacman-contrib.
+ bacman: backup installed packages
+ pacdiff: deal with pacsave and pacnew files
+ pactree: list dependency tree of a package
+ extra/pkgfile: find the packages a certain file belongs to
* AUR/yaourt
** AUR: Arch user repository
** yaourt: yet another user repository tool
   A good wrapper for pacman
* Create repos using repo-add
* Configurations
** pacman.conf
+ Configure pacman, add repositories, etc.
** makepkg.conf
+ Set CFLAGS,CXXFLAGS, etc.
+ Use ccache,distcc to build packages

* Open Build Service
